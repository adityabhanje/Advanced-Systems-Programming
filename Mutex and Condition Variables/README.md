For this project, there needs to be a file named "input.txt" in the folder where the submitted code (combiner.c) is present which contains the input tuples. On running the makefile, the executable "combiner" gets created. After this, just type the following in the command prompt:

./combiner <buffersize> <no. of users>

For example, if the buffer size is 5 and the no. of distinct users in the input.txt file is 7, just type

./combiner 5 7

For reference, an input file(input.txt) and a file containing output obtained on running the above code with the given sample input file (output.txt) is provided as well.
